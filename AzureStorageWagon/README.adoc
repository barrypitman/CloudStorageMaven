= AzureStorageWagon

The AzureStorageWagon project enables you to upload your artifacts to an Azure Blob storage account. The original blog post on this subject is here: https://egkatzioura.com/2018/04/09/host-your-maven-artifacts-using-azure-blob-storage/

== Instructions

Add the wagon dependency to your pom.xml file as a build extension.

== Authentication methods

You can authenticate to Azure using 3 different methods:

=== Access keys
This is the original solution. In settings.xml, the username should contain the storage account name, and the password should contain a storage account access key. The disadvantage to this approach is that storage account keys allow for complete control over the entire storage account. Most users only require READ access.

=== Shared access signatures
To use shared access signatures, specify the shared access signature in the settings.xml username field, and leave the password empty. SAS give a better level of control compared to access keys, and can be scoped to particular directories, and restricted to read-only access where required. However, this solution might not scale well to many users, since SAS tokens cannot be revoked without rotating access keys and invalidating all SAS signatures.

=== Azure AD using service principal
If your storage account uses Azure AD for authentication (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/authorize-access-azure-active-directory), then you can also use a service principal for authentication. To use Azure AD authentication the fields in settings.xml should be configured as follows:

- username: client_id
- password: client_secret
- passphrase: tenant_id
- privateKey: endpoint (e.g. https://<name>.blob.core.windows.net)

This will allow you manage access to the repo using Azure RBAC.
